[Verse 1]



What if I told you that I didn't feel good enough and I'm broken



What if I said that I'm losin' my faith and been struggling with coping



Been stuck for a while



When I look at the clock man I feel like it's frozen



Then again time is just flying too quick



And I'm losing devotion



Truth is I feel no emotion



Bottled it up and all I feel is rage



And I would be lying if I looked at you and said I'm not afraid



What if I never get through this shit



What do I do if I can't find my way



And I know that my father has been counting on me to carry our name



Speakin' of him and I got to be honest



We ain't really speakin' these days



I've been scared that I won't get to know him before the day he fades away



My family fought a lot when I was growin' up



What can I say?



What can I say?



What can I say?



By fightin', there ain't really nothin' to gain



I know that the sun is out there somewhere



But I've been livin' in rain



Can we quit playin' games



I'm standin' right here and I'm ready to change



And mama I promise to give you the world if I make it to fame



Put you both on a stage and make it so everyone's screamin' your name







[Chorus]



It's times like this I see your face



Wish you didn't leave this place



Searchin' for the reason why



So take a moment of silence, goodbye







[Verse 2]



Give me a second



I wanna say something to my little brother



When you get older, your father is not gonna be with your mother



I'm 23 years older than you, I know it's kinda confusing



Forget all the bullies that make fun of you, it's just for their amusement



Let go of negative, seek out the light



Develop yourself, you should journal and write



Speak with integrity, treat women right



And you don't gotta drink every typical night



Being popular really ain't everythin'



Nah don't give into that hype



And it's okay to forgive the people that hurt you



But don't give in twice



And to each of my sisters



I know we been drifted, our parents divorced, We all moved away, and the family shifted



Yeah we visit on Christmas



But even the holidays' different



Got to make something out of this gift that God has graciously gifted



I know that the sun is out there somewhere but I've been livin' in rain



Can we quit playin' games



I'm standin' right here and I'm ready to change



And mama I promise to give you the world if I make it to fame



Put you both on a stage and make it so everyone's screamin' your name







[Chorus]



It's times like this I see your face



Wish you didn't leave this place



Searchin' for the reason why



So take a moment of silence, goodbye



I'm grateful for all that you gave me (gave me)





[Verse 3]



Give me a second



I owe an apology to a few people



I regret a few things and I made some mistakes when I gave into evil



To all my exes I'm sorry I know I was often deceitful



But after Veronica cheated, I gave up and didn't treat future girls equal



I'm sorry to all that I pushed away when I fell deep in depression



I never gave enough attention to people I love so I just started ruinin' friendships



I guess that I taken the easy way out by rapping confessions



This is a passion of mine and the only way that I can deal with my stresses



And I get emotional every time I stop and think about Taylor



Still can't believe that you took your own life away just to get rid of these haters



I just hope that you found some peace and serenity in your decision



No one knew what you were going through



Then again maybe we just didn't listen



To my granny, I wish that I said goodbye before the day that you left



Not telling you how much I love you is something that I still regret



But I know you're in heaven and that it's all okay



One day I'll be with you, and all my fans will be screamin' my name







[Outro]



This song is dedicated to Taylor Eller. We love you. And may you rest in peace
