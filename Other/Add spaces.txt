[Hook]

If I could ask a million questions

That would leave me wanting more

That’s why I let you do the talking

Maybe that’s what talking’s for (maybe that’s what talking’s for)



[Lucidious: Verse 1]

I'm looking at you

Looking at me

Both of us scared the others gon’ leave



How do you feel?

What do you see?

Us the future what do you believe?



Tears in your eyes

Heart on my sleeve

You're the reason I'm losing my sleep



I know it hurts

Trying to breathe

Beg for forgiveness we down on our knees



Truth is a bitch

Lies even worse

Wish that I never went into your purse



Looked at your phone

Talking to guys

Happened before so it's not surprise



Still we don't leave

Why do we stay

Guess that I like feeling all of this pain



Drink it away

Sleeping all day

Isolate feel like I'm losing my faith



Push and we shove

Fight and make love

Called you a bitch blow it off with a shrug



You know I'm sorry I know you are to

Neither of us could be telling the truth I don't know what to do

But I know we can no longer take the abuse



Guess I'm afraid it'll never comeback and this is track will be all I got left of the past



[Pre-hook]

Stop looking at me like I'm crazy

Never thought that you would change me

Never thought that I would change you

Some of your actions have made me



And you always told me I saved you

I want you to know that you saved me

I'm sorry if I ever played you

I'm grateful for all that you gave me (gave me)

[Lucidious: Verse 2]

I know that you hate me for writing this

I know that it hurts when you hear it

I know that you hate the attention I get for this music and writing some lyrics



I know that you're sick of complaining

I’m sorry you're feeling so anxious

I promise that drinking a lot will do nothing but hurt you until you embrace it



And I know that you're scared of the future

I know that you hate your reflection

I know we pretend to be perfect

But that's after like 20 exceptions



Yeah walking away was an option

But neither of us would accept it

Right when we start to get better we do something stupid and one of us wrecks it



I struggle to show you affection

You asking a million questions



Losing my mind

Think we need space

Look at the shit it's affecting



Missing the days that we both used to laugh when the fuck did we get so possessive

I guess I'm afraid to give up and let go of everything that we have invested



[Pre-hook]

Stop looking at me like I'm crazy

Never thought that you would change me

And you always told me I saved you

I want you to know that you saved me

I'm grateful for all that you gave me (gave me)
