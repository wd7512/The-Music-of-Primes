All my friends say "you're hangin' by a thread"

All my friends say "She'll leave your heart bleeding red"

I always thought that love was soft and stupid

Holding hands and poetry

I always thought that it was made for everyone just not for me

Then there you were on a Tuesday morning

Corner of 8th and Church

Well ain't it funny how your world stops turning

When you meet the one who makes you hurt so bad

Now all my friends say I'm just hanging by a thread

All my friends say "she'll leave your heart bleeding red"

Maybe I'm a fool

But baby I'm a fool for you

Well oh my goodness gracious what am I feeling?

Can't take my eyes away from her for what it's worth

I think your little freckles have

the power to break me down into the dirt

Into the dirt

All my friends say I'm just hanging by a thread

Yeah all my friends say you'll leave my heart bleeding red

And maybe I'm a fool

But baby I'm a fool for you

Maybe I'm a fool

But baby I'm a fool for you

All my friends say I'm just hangin' by a thread

All my friends say "she'll leave your heart bleeding red"

And maybe I'm a fool

But baby I'm a fool for you
