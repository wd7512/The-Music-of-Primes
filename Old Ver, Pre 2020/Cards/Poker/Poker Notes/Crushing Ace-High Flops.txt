Two Rules that Govern Solid Poker

	-(1) If your oppenent bets or raises, you should usually continue.
		-We do not allow our opponent outright profitable bets.

	-(2) If you bet one street and your opponent calls, you should usually bet again on the next card.
		-We apply pressure to hands that cant handle it
		-We avoid letting the villan make easy bluffs

	-The word 'usually' used in these situations can be used at 70% as a starting point

	-Our range can be seen as a pyramid from preflop-flop-turn-river.
		-Each round should have a consitient of hands folding.
		-This leads to a 'smooth pyramid'

	-Most oppentents do not follow these rules

The Aggressor

	-Example
		-Flop [As,8h,4c]
		-Often the preflop raiser may CB 100% of the time
			-This leads to the jagged pyramid with a large flop
			-Breaking rule 2

		-The opponent is often folding too much of the time
			-This leads to a jagged pyramid with a small flop
			-Breaking rule 1
	
	-In general people dont want to play for stacks on these textures

	-The opponent needs to defend with more than just top pair+

	-GTO suggests... 
		-The agressor should CB 40% of the time
			-King x usually checks
		-The opponent calls 45% of the time
			-King x usually fold
			-Any Ace calls
	
	-Exploitative Play
		-The opponent only gives action with middle pair+
			-The agressor should bluff nearly everything as the BB is folding too much
		-The agressor is CB 100% of the time
			-The opponent should call then do one of the following
				-Donk the turn
				-Bet river after checked turn
