2 players x,y
each player has a range of hands starting with 72/144

x blind checks 0
y bets 1 if their hand is in their range otherwise checks 0
x calls 1 if their hand is in their range otherwise folds
then all five cards are played with no more betting

this is repeated a certain amount of times
the winning range then widens and the losing range tightens

repeat all.
